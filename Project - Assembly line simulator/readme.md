In this workshop, created a simulator of an assembly line which hold a set of workstations, which then hold a set of stock items, which are specific to a station. A line manager is responsible for moving customer orders along the line. A customer order contains a list of items that are filled by different stations. Each station process a queue of orders and try to complete the order if the order contains the item handled by that station and that item is in stock. At the end of the line, orders are either complete or incomplete due to a lack of inventory at one or more stations. The application displays both types of orders(completed or incompleted) once the line manager has finished processing them.

Modules developed were implemented by using the terminology of file stream concepts, STL containers, algorithms, iterators, string library, dynamic 2-d, 1-d arrays, operator overloading, inheritance, composition, exception handling and move semantics.
