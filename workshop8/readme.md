This workshops made me to get hands on practice in using smart pointers as compared to raw pointers.
The following are some of my learnings:
a) used a smart pointer to move an object
b) managed to deallocate the heap memory even if exception occurs before deallocation
c) implemented Luhn algorithm to validate Social Insurance Number.
d) created a program of Quadratic Time Complexity.
