In this workshop, a CPU-like central unit was created that can host and manage various individual processing units called microprocessors. These units then process different kinds of jobs and reports error if any comes with in the processing of those jobs. Central Unit's work was not limited to just microprocessors but also to any other type of individual unit. This functionality was achieved by making CentralUnit a templated class. In the modules, function objects were used and lambda expressions were also implemented.  Management of individual units with in Central unit was done by making a dynamic 2-D array of those units and then deallocating their memory as required. Various kinds of exceptions were thrown and handled for processing of jobs assigned to microprocessors.
