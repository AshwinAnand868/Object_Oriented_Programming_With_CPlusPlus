This workshop was completed by using STL algorithms and its functionality is to manage a collection of covids or Covid class objects. Major implmentations of this workshop include:
a) copying data from a formatted file into a sequential container.
b) using algorithm library functions: sort, for_each, transform, any_of, count_if, copy_if for a variety of purposes. 
c) appling accumulate function of numeric libary for addition of data values
d) making use of lambda expressions to specify an operation on each value in a data set
