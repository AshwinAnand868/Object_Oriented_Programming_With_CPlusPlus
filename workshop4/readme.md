In this workshop, I learned how to implement classes that are in the composition and aggregation relationships with each other. 
The classes simulate an order system for children's toys. The child manages a collection of toys (composition) and an order 
system is for sending confirmations for those toys. By this workshop, first time, I worked with double pointers in C++.
